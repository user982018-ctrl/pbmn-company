== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The menu does not appear on the website. How can I fix it? =
If the menu does not appear, it may be due to **caching**. Try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Clear your browser cache** â€“ press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to refresh the page without cache.
2. **Clear your WordPress cache** â€“ if you're using a caching plugin (e.g., WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache), clear the cache in the plugin settings.
3. **Purge server cache** â€“ if your hosting provider uses caching (e.g., Cloudflare, SiteGround, or Nginx cache), clear the cache from your hosting panel.
4. **Disable caching temporarily** â€“ if the issue persists, try disabling the caching plugin and check if the menu appears.

= The menu is visible to the site administrator but not to users? =
Check if the **"Test Mode"** option is enabled. If **Test Mode** is activated, the menu will be visible **only to the site administrator** but not to regular users.

= Can I change the menu position? =
Yes, you can set the menu to appear on the **left or right side** of the screen in the plugin settings.

= Can I display the menu only on specific pages? =
Yes! In the **Lite version**, you can:
- **Show the menu on all pages** of your website.
- **Insert the menu manually** using a **shortcode** `[Float-Menu id="1"]` to display it only where needed.

In the **Pro version**, you can set **advanced display rules** to show the menu only on specific pages, categories, post types, or based on user roles.

= Can I use multiple menus on the same page? =
Yes, you can create and display **multiple menus** on a single page. Each menu has its own settings and can be controlled separately.

= How do I use the plugin on a multisite? =
If you're using a Multisite WordPress installation, **do not activate** the plugin for the entire network. Instead, activate it **individually on each site** where you need it.

No, **Float Menu is lightweight and optimized for speed**, ensuring minimal impact on your website's performance.
