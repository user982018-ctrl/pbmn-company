Other than caching SpeedyCache can also do the following:-
1. It can minify and combine CSS/JS giving even better optimization as it reduces the file sizes and reduces the HTTP requests to the server.
2. Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript resources helping your website to load faster.
3. Lazy load images so that the images can be requested only if they come into the viewport.
4. GZIP files to reduce the size of the file sent from the server.

== Pro Features:- ==

* **Image Optimization:** Image optimization is a way to convert an image to next-gen image formats like webp which load images faster on the web.
* **Instant Page:** It loads the page just before user clicks the link, reducing the page load time.
* **Google Fonts:** Google fonts are also seen as render-blocking so this feature helps load Google fonts asynchronously.
* **Local Google Fonts:** Cache the Google fonts to be compliant with the GDPR rules.
* **Lazy Load:** Loading all assets at once can make the page load slower hence lazy load helps by only loading certain resources when they come into the viewport.
* **Minify HTML:** It removes empty lines, line breaks, minifies inline Js And Css, removes comments and space in Tags
* **Minify JS:** Reduces JS file size.
* **Delay JS:** Delays the JS to load on user interaction to reduce or remove the issue of Unused JS.
* **Advanced Combine JS:** Combines JS files placed in the footer section helping reduce HTTP calls.
* **Render blocking JS:** Before rendering a page the browser parses the HTML to create a DOM tree and if an external script comes it has to stop and wait for the script to execute hence the rendering of the page ends up taking time, hence Render blocking JS feature helps in deferring the load of JS after the render has happened hence the first load get faster.
* **Delete Cache Stats:** Provides statistics about the cached files of Desktop or Mobile version and combined/ minified version of CSS and JS.
* **Mobile Cache:** Caches the mobile version of your website and shows that version on mobile devices.

== Caching ==
SpeedyCache caches the website by creating static files on the server and delivers those static files to most of the users who visit the website, The static files eliminate the heavy load of Querying the database for data hence the load of your website is faster.

You can preload as many pages as you want, and preloading caches the website in regular intervals of time to reduce the load on the server.

Deleting Cache on New/updating Post.
You can decide to delete the cache on the creation or updating of a post so that the cache can always stay updated.


== Minifying/Combining CSS and JS ==
SpeedyCache helps minify the JS and CSS hence it reduces the file sizes.
Combining JS combines the CSS and JS fines reducing the file count and making the server handle lesser requests.


== Cache Lifespan ==
Cache Lifespan is a way to schedule the deletion of cache.


== Exclude ==
Exclude is a way to prevent SpeedyCache from caching certain files/ user-agents/ cookies.


== CDN (Content Delivery Network) ==
CDN helps you host your static content on a distributed network optimized to deliver internet content faster it's not a replacement to a web host. It caches your files on the network edge and delivers the content to the user through the closest and fastest server.
SpeedyCache helps you integrate a CDN by rewriting the URLs of the static files you want to host on the CDN or in the Case of Cloudflare it helps with the purging of the cache on the Cloudflare servers.


== [Pro] Image Optimization ==
Image optimization is a way to convert your images from old formats like JPG and PNG to the new next-gen formats like webp which is designed with the web as the target platform to load images faster. webp images result in smaller and richer images that make the web faster.
