= What is Wheel of Life? =

The Wheel of Life is an assessment tool used in life coaching to help people assess and manage their life priorities. It's a diagram with six spokes, each representing a different area of life: health, wealth, relationships, personal growth, contribution and fun/leisure.

The idea is to score how satisfied you are with each area on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the highest. This gives you a good overview of where you're doing well and where you could use some improvement.

The Wheel of Life coaching tool can be a helpful tool in setting goals and creating a plan to achieve them. It's also a useful way to check in with yourself periodically to see how you're doing. If an area of your life is suffering, it can help you to identify what needs to change.
